# Fraise #

Fraise is a fresh, minimal business or portfolio theme. A light but striking color scheme and crisp typography lets your site stand out from the crowd.

## Jetpack Features ##

Fraise supports the following Jetpack features (note that a WordPress.com account is not required for any of these features):

* Social Media Menu
* Featured Content

### Social Media Menu

Fraise features a special menu with links to your social media sites in the footer, with icons for the major social media networks. To use this menu, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Dashboard and then go to Appearance > Menus. Create a new menu and name it whatever you'd like.

2. Select "Custom Links" from the accordion menu on the left (where it says "Pages", "Custom Links", and "Categories"), and in the text boxes marked "URL", enter your URL. For example, for Twitter, you would write https://twitter.com/your-twitter-username.

3. Click the "Add to Menu" button. Repeat for every social media network you'd like to add.

4. Once your menu is created, click the "Save Menu" button, and then click on the "Manage Locations" tab near the top of the screen. Assign your newly-created menu to the "Social Menu" location.

## Header Color ##

The "Header Text Color" setting (Appearance > Customize > Colors > Header Text Color) also controls the color of the menu toggle (but not the color of the menu itself) and the text of the featured content slider, if it exists.
